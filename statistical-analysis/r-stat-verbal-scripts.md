# Open R Studio
- Start with no Rmd file and briefly introduce the main parts of the interface. 
- Open the Rmd file from the file menu. 
- Briefly explain why we use Rmd format for our workshops. 
- Show the “play” icons next to each code block and and the keyboard shortcut in the top right corner, tell participants that’s how they will be able to follow along
- Use the participants pane to ask about the pace at least once during the workshop (e.g. a green check-mark if the pace is just right, or the “speed up” or “slow down” icons). Tell people that you’d like to hear from everyone and give them time to respond.
- Pay attention to time, and have a break half way
- If there are time left, use it as an Q&A section
